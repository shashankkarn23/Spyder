# Spyder
Spyder is an android application that turns your device into parental control device that is capable of recording audio video files and uploads the recorded audio video files to the remote email address. By default, Spyder uploads audio video files after interval of 2 hours. You can customize it in settings along with remote email. We advise you to continuously save recorded audio videos files sent to remote email as it may not be available second time as we don't create backup of any audio video files. This application will work in hidden mode; a child cannot find that application in hidden option given in smart phone. To hide the application you have to call on "**11##" and to unhide the application you have to use "**22##".
